## Description

Scripts to recreate the trade data available at the [Observatory of Economic Complexity](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/). 

We have a repo explaining the methodological details. Please visit [OEC Documentation](https://observatory-economic-complexity.github.io/oec-documentation/) and the [Official website](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/) for the details. 

These scripts are released under MIT license.

## How to use this project

While you can run the scripts from UNIX terminal, we highly recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Each project is organized as an RStudio project. Each project contains a master script titled `0-some-function.R` at the top level but some projects such as _Product Space_ are organized in subfolders where each subfolder contains a master script.

The master script, for any case, runs a function with user prompt and/or simple scripts. The safe way to run this without errors is to open the project and then run the master script from RStudio.

[OEC Packages Snapshot](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/oec-packages-snapshot) contains a bundle to avoid dependencies or packages related problems, but this project already contains an unbundled set of packages to ease reproducibility.

You can read more about RStudio projects [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

## Output

The script generates different files at the top of the project. 

### Generated files

#### Country codes (xls)

```{r codes1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(readxl::read_excel("country-codes.xls")) %>% skimr::kable()
```

#### Country codes (json)

```{r codes2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(jsonlite::fromJSON("country-codes.json")$results) %>% skimr::kable()
```

#### Official correspondence between UN COMTRADE codes

```{r correspondence, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(readxl::read_excel("official-correspondence-between-comtrade-codes.xlsx")) %>% skimr::kable()
```

#### Official list of UN COMTRADE codes

```{r list, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(readxl::read_excel("official-list-of-comtrade-codes.xlsx")) %>% skimr::kable()
```

## Software details
